                The first constitution to start with a preamble was the American Constitution.
                The Indian constitution also starts with one. The Preamble is basically the
                introduction or preface to the constitution. It sums up the essence of the
                constitution. N A Palkhivala, a constitutional expert, referred to the Preamble
                as the ‘Identity card of the Constitution’.
                The Preamble is based on Pandit Nehru’s Objective Resolution that he moved
                and was adopted by the Constituent Assembly. The Preamble has been
                amended in 1976 by the 42nd Amendment which added words ‘socialist’,
                ‘secular’ and ‘integrity’ to it.
                Ingredients of the Preamble
                The Preamble gives 4 components:
                Source of authority of the Constitution: it mentions that the constitution
                derives its power from the people of India.
                Nature of the Indian State: it says India is a sovereign, socialist, secular,
                democratic and republican State.
                Objectives of the Constitution: it gives the objectives as – justice, liberty,
                equality and fraternity.
                Constitution date of adoption: 26th November 1949
