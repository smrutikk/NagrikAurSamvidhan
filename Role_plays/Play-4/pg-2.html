        "Sir, what makes them different from the Fundamental Rights ?",
        "While Fundamental Rights are enforceable in courts, Directive Principles are not. They serve as a framework for the government's policies and actions.",
        "Can you please give me an example of a Directive Principle?",
        "Certainly! One of the key Directive Principles is to secure a social order that promotes the welfare of the people. This includes ensuring social justice, equality, and economic development.?",
        "I see. So, the government should work towards a better society for everyone.",
        "Exactly. Another important Directive Principle is to provide free legal aid to those who cannot afford it. This helps to ensure that everyone has access to justice.",
        "That's a great idea. Are there any other Directive Principles that we should know about?",
        " The government can achieve these goals through various means, such as:Legislation: Passing laws to protect the environment, promote international peace, and ensure social justice. Policy implementation: Developing and implementing policies that support these goals. International cooperation: Working with other countries to address global challenges.",
        "I see. So, the Directive Principles are not just about the government's intentions, but also about its actions.",
        "Exactly. They are a framework that guides the government's policies and decisions.",
        " Can you give me a specific example of how the government has implemented a Directive Principle?",
        "One example is the National Food Security Act, which aims to ensure food security for a large section of the population. This Act is based on the Directive Principle of providing social justice and welfare.",
        "That's a great example. It's clear that the Directive Principles play a crucial role in shaping our society.",
        "Absolutely. They provide a vision for a just and equitable society and guide the government's efforts to achieve that vision.",
        "Thank sir !!"
